 # Flags-And-Borders
Simple app that shows a list of all flags exist. You can search for a country and touch a flag to see its borders. 

Things i've done:
- AsyncTask (which got deprecated) for pulling API requests on background. 
- Parsing JSON data
- Fragments
- Decoding and converting SVG into ImageView
- Custom RecyclerView touch listener
- Search filter inside of Recycler's adapter
- Splash screen using theme launcher.
